instructions:

To run this program, open up the command line. 
It should look something like this:
c:\users\username>
Use cd to move to the file you saved it in.
For example, if you saved it in a folder on your desktop, type cd desktop\foldername
It should look like this when you are finished:
c:\users\username> cd desktop\foldername
When you are in the folder you want, type caesarcipher. Instructions will display on the screen.


If you need help understanding what the instructions mean, here is an explanation:
-e means encrypt, -d means decrypt. 
you type in either -e or -d, then the cipher key, then the file that you want to encrypt/decrypt.
If for some reason you don't know how a Cipher works, the key is basically your password.
Like if you typed 20 as your key to encrypt the message, you will need to type 20 when decrypting it.

Encrypting looks like this. I used 83 as my key, and inputfile.txt as the file I want to encrypt: 
-e 83 inputfile.txt
A file named "encrypted.txt" will appear with the hidden message.
To decrypt, you just type the same thing but type -d instead and you type the name of the encrypted file instead.
It looks like this:
-d 83 encrypted.txt
